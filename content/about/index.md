My name is John (sometimes "JK"). I am a born and raised Minnesota native currently
living in the west Twin Cities metro area.

I have had the privilege of working in many facets of technology throughout my
career: software development, Linux systems administration, network security,
digital forensics, enterprise storage, and site reliability among others.
Presently I work at [AerisWeather][1] where my chief responsibility is
overseeing cloud infrastructure.

In my spare time, you'll find me tackling whatever technical problem scratches
my personal itch. I also enjoy video games, home improvement, spending time
with my lovely girlfriend Val and cat Darla, and cooking, lately.
